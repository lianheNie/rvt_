/*
 * This function performs the last stage of a real FFT of size M in place.
 * Before this step is performed, a size M/2 complex FFT must be performed
 * on the input data with bit reversal. This algorithm has been optimized
 * to use a single coefficient lookup table and a reduced number of multiply
 * operations. The complex result G(k) where k = 0,1,2...N-1 and N = M/2 is
 * calculated as follows:
 *
 *     G(k) = 0.5*(X(k) + X*(N-k)) - 0.5*j*(e^-j2*pi*k/2N)*(X(k) - X*(N-k))
 *
 * This can be optimized by calculating G(N-k) in parallel using the following
 * simplification:
 *
 *     G(N-k) = 0.5*(X(N-k) + X*(N-(N-k))) - 0.5*j*(e^-j2*pi*(N-k)/2N)*(X(N-k) - X*(N-(N-k)))
 *     G(N-k) = 0.5*(X(N-k) + X*(k)) - 0.5*j*(e^-j2*pi*(N-k)/2N)*(X(N-k) - X*(k))
 *     G(N-k) = 0.5*(X(N-k) + X*(k)) - 0.5*j*-(e^-j2*pi*(N-k)/2N)*(X*(k) - X(N-k))
 *     G(N-k) = 0.5*(X(k) + X*(N-k))* - 0.5*j*((e^-j2*pi*k/2N)*(X(k) - X*(N-k)))*
 *
 * The common components of G(k) and G(N-k) can be calculated once as local
 * variables A and B:
 *
 *     A(k) = 0.5*(X(k) + X*(N-k))
 *     B(k) = 0.5*(e^-j2*pi*k/2N)*(X(k) - X*(N-k))
 *
 * Finally, performing substitutions to the G(k) and G(N-k) equations yields
 * the following optimized equations:
 * 
 *     G(k) = A(k) - j*B(k)
 *     G(N-k) = A*(k) - j*B*(k)
